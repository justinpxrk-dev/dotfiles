Things that break silently when an upstream tool is upgraded — nothing here is caught by a test or lint, so scan this before `brew upgrade`, or when something stops working right after one.

## Lua version coupling (sketchybar + LuaRocks)

The Catppuccin palette reaches sketchybar as a LuaRocks rock loaded by SbarLua's embedded Lua. That ties the bar to a single Lua `major.minor`, which appears in three places that must all agree:

1. **What the bar runs** — `dot_config/sketchybar/lib/SbarLua/makefile` pins
   `LUA_DIR=lua-5.5.0`, statically linked into `sketchybar.so`.
2. **Where the rock installs** — Homebrew's `lua` version decides the tree:
   `~/.luarocks/share/lua/<major.minor>/`.
3. **Where the bar looks** — `dot_config/sketchybar/executable_sketchybarrc` adds
   `~/.luarocks/share/lua/5.5/` to `package.path`.

All three are **5.5** today (Homebrew `lua` is `5.5.0`, matching SbarLua's pin).

**Failure mode:** bump Homebrew `lua` to a new minor (say 5.6) and the rock reinstalls under `lua/5.6/`, while `sketchybarrc` still points at `lua/5.5/`. `require("catppuccin")` then fails and the bar errors or drops its colors — with nothing flagged at `chezmoi apply` time.

**On a Lua upgrade:**

1. Bump the `5.5` in `executable_sketchybarrc`'s `package.path` to the new `major.minor`.
2. Reinstall the rock into the new tree: `luarocks install --local catppuccin`.
3. Keep SbarLua's `LUA_DIR` pin aligned with Homebrew's `lua`.
